# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Reclaim team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Email**: security@reclaim.protocol (placeholder)
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations for fixing
6. **Your Contact**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

### Bug Bounty Program

We plan to establish a bug bounty program with rewards based on severity:

| Severity | Reward Range | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Critical | $5,000 - $50,000 | Fund theft, unauthorized access to funds |
| High | $1,000 - $5,000 | Denial of service, privilege escalation |
| Medium | $250 - $1,000 | Information disclosure, minor vulnerabilities |
| Low | $50 - $250 | Best practice violations, informational |

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions (RBAC)
   - Owner-only functions for critical operations
   - Multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions

2. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
   - State updates before external calls

3. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
   - Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow checks
   - SafeMath for additional operations

4. **Input Validation**
   - Address zero checks
   - Amount bounds validation
   - Interval constraints
   - Token whitelist (where applicable)

5. **Token Handling**
   - SafeERC20 for all token operations
   - Approval checks before transfers
   - Balance verification

### Frontend Security

1. **Web3 Security**
   - Transaction simulation before execution
   - User confirmation for all actions
   - Display transaction details clearly
   - Verify contract addresses

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - Address validation (ethers.js)
   - Amount format validation
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection prevention (if applicable)

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Never expose private keys
   - Secure API key storage
   - Different keys for dev/prod

### Operational Security

1. **Deployment**
   - Multi-sig wallet control
   - Timelock for upgrades
   - Gradual rollout strategy
   - Comprehensive testing on testnet

2. **Monitoring**
   - 24/7 transaction monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert system for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

3. **Incident Response**
   - Emergency pause mechanism
   - Incident response plan
   - Communication protocols
   - Recovery procedures

## Known Limitations

### Current Version

1. **Price Oracle Dependency**
   - Relies on owner to update prices
   - 24-hour price validity window
   - No automatic failover

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Requires manual or automated trigger
   - No built-in scheduler
   - Depends on external service or user action

3. **Gas Costs**
   - High during network congestion
   - No built-in gas optimization for batching

4. **Refund Mechanism**
   - Requires creator approval
   - No automatic refund processing
   - Time window restrictions

### Future Enhancements

Planned security improvements:

1. Implement Chainlink price feeds
2. ERC-4337 account abstraction integration
3. Automated payment processing with Gelato
4. Enhanced emergency pause mechanisms
5. Formal verification of critical functions
6. Implement upgrade proxy pattern
7. Add insurance fund
