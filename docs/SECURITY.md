# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@reclaim.xyz with details
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## Security Measures

### Smart Contracts

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token transfers
- **Access Control**: Owner-based permissions for sensitive functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checks
- **Events**: All state changes emit events for transparency

### Best Practices

1. **Audits**: Conduct security audits before mainnet deployment
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
3. **Gas Optimization**: Efficient code to minimize attack surface
4. **Upgradability**: Consider proxy patterns for future updates
5. **Multi-sig**: Use multi-signature wallets for admin functions

### Known Limitations

- Contracts are currently non-upgradeable
- Reliance on external ERC20 token implementations
- Gas price fluctuations may affect transaction execution

## Deployment Security

### Private Key Management

- Never commit private keys to git
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet
- Store keys in secure key management systems
- Implement key rotation policies

### Network Security

- Use VPN when deploying
- Verify RPC endpoint security
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Implement rate limiting

## User Security

### For Subscribers

- Review subscription details before confirming
- Monitor your subscriptions regularly
- Cancel unused subscriptions
- Keep sufficient balance for payments
- Understand refund policies

### For Creators

- Set reasonable refund policies
- Monitor subscription activity
- Withdraw funds regularly
- Implement additional verification for high-value subscriptions

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Pause affected contracts (if possible)
2. Assess the impact
3. Notify affected users
4. Implement fixes
5. Deploy patched version
6. Post-mortem analysis
7. Update security measures
